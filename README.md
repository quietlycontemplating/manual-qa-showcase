# Manual QA Showcase

This repository highlights my hands-on learning and application of manual QA fundamentals, including:

- 🧪 Structured Test Cases
- 🐞 Real Bug Reports
- 🔍 Exploratory Testing Checklists

These samples are based on real-world flows from public sites and my own projects (e.g., awakenyourinnerfire.com).

**Tools used:** Jira, Google Docs, Chrome DevTools
