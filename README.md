A simple QA portfolio featuring manual test cases, bug reports, and exploratory testing checklists.
# Manual QA Portfolio – Sharnelle Guthrie

Welcome! This is a curated portfolio showcasing my manual QA work and systems thinking. It includes test cases, bug reports, and exploratory testing checklists designed for startups and early-stage product teams.

## 📁 What's Included

- **/test-cases** – Realistic manual test cases (e.g., login form, contact form)
- **/bug-reports** – Sample bug reports with steps to reproduce and severity tags
- **/exploratory-checklists** – A checklist-style QA approach to common flows

## 🧠 Why This Exists

I built this portfolio to show not just what I can do, but how I think.

With 6+ years in quality auditing, trust & safety, and CX operations, I bring both technical precision and a user-first mindset to QA. I believe good testers don't just catch bugs, they anticipate them.
