|--------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1      | Leave Name field blank                 | Error message: "Name is required"     |
| 2      | Leave Email field blank                | Error message: "Email is required"    |

## Notes  
- Errors should be visually distinct (e.g., red text, icons), but there are none. The page doesn't move forward without the fields populated, but error messages are needed, especially if users cannot understand things intuitively.
