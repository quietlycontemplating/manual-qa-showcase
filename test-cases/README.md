Test Cases

This folder contains sample manual test cases written as part of my QA training and real-world practice.
Each test case outlines:
* Preconditions
* Clear step-by-step actions
* Expected vs. actual results (if tested live)
* Use cases from common public platforms or personal projects
These test cases demonstrate my ability to think critically, document clearly, and test features like login flows, form submissions, and profile updates.
Tools used: Jira, browser dev tools, Google Docs, Notion and markdown formatting.
